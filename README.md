# work-day-calendar-application

For this assignment, I developed a work day calendar where the user will be able to enter information they need to to do or have appointments and save it by clicking the save button on the side. Once it has been saved, it can be found in the local storage and when they refresh the page, the information will still appear. 
On the top of the browser, there's a live time and the date. Throughout the day, the colors will change based on the time, if its present, it will be orange, past will be blue, and green for future.

Kindly find attached a screenshot of the assignmnet and the deployed link.
